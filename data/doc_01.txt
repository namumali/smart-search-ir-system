Tries are efficient data structures for string storage and retrieval.
A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings character by character.
Tries provide fast prefix matching and autocomplete functionality.
Each node in a trie represents a character in the string.
Tries are commonly used in search engines and spell checkers.
The time complexity for searching in a trie is O(m) where m is the length of the string.
Tries can be more space-efficient than hash tables for certain applications.
Prefix trees enable rapid word lookups and pattern matching in text processing.
