<p>B+ Trees are used in databases for indexing and storage.</p>
<p>B+ Trees maintain sorted data and allow efficient insertion and deletion.</p>
<p>Internal nodes in B+ Trees store keys and pointers to child nodes.</p>
<p>Leaf nodes in B+ Trees store actual data records.</p>
<p>B+ Trees are balanced tree structures that minimize disk I/O operations.</p>
<p>Database systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL use B+ Trees for indexing.</p>
<p>B+ Trees provide logarithmic time complexity for search operations.</p>
<p>The structure of B+ Trees makes them ideal for range queries and sequential access.</p>
