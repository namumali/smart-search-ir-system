Merge Sort Algorithm

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.
The algorithm divides the array into halves recursively.
Merge Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
The merge step combines two sorted subarrays into one sorted array.
Merge Sort requires additional space for the merging process.
Merge Sort is efficient for large datasets and external sorting.
