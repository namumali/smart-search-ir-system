Tree Data Structures

Binary trees have at most two children per node.
Binary search trees maintain sorted order for efficient searching.
AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees.
Red-black trees provide balanced tree operations.
B-trees are optimized for disk storage and databases.
Tree traversal includes preorder, inorder, and postorder methods.
Tree structures are fundamental in computer science algorithms.
