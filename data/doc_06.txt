Data Structures Fundamentals

Data structures organize and store data efficiently.
Arrays provide constant-time access but fixed size.
Linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation.
Trees enable hierarchical data organization.
Hash tables provide fast key-value lookups.
Choosing the right data structure depends on the use case.
Time and space complexity analysis guides data structure selection.
