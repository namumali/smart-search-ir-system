<p>Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm.</p>
<p>Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.</p>
<p>The algorithm divides the array into halves recursively.</p>
<p>Merge Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.</p>
<p>The merge step combines two sorted subarrays into one sorted array.</p>
<p>Merge Sort requires additional space for the merging process.</p>
<p>Merge Sort is efficient for large datasets and external sorting.</p>
<p>The recursive nature of merge sort makes it predictable and reliable.</p>
