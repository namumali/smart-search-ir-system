Big O notation describes algorithm time complexity.
Time complexity measures how runtime grows with input size.
Space complexity measures memory usage of algorithms.
Best case, average case, and worst case scenarios differ.
Amortized analysis considers average performance over operations.
Complexity analysis helps compare algorithm efficiency.
Optimization often involves trading time for space or vice versa.
Understanding complexity is crucial for scalable software design.
